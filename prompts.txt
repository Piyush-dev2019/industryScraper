Analyze the following URLs and rank the most relevant ones for finding information about:
  - Annual Reports
  - Industry Strategy Documents
  - Financial Reports
  - Budget Plans
  - Mission Plans
  - Sectoral Publications

Strict Filtering Rules:
1. Ignore any links to content older than 2020 or archive pages before 2020.
2. Ignore any paginated URLs beyond page 2 (e.g., URLs with "page=3" or "page/4").
3. Ignore links that are not in English (e.g., URLs containing "/hi/").
4. Ignore links to general notices, circulars, tenders, guidelines, operational memos, or purely administrative content.
5. Ignore links to monthly or weekly summary reports.
6. **Base path filtering logic**:
   - If both a parent URL and a sub-URL are present (e.g., https://site.com/policy and https://site.com/policy/document-2023), **only keep the parent URL**.
   - A "parent URL" is any URL that is a prefix of another.
   - If a parent URL exists, **exclude all deeper sub-URLs that start with the same base path**.
   - Only include the sub-URL if its parent is not in the list.

Return ONLY a JSON array in this exact format — no explanation or extra output:

Analyze the following URLs and rank the most relevant ones for finding information about:
  - Annual Reports
  - Industry Strategy Documents
  - Financial Reports
  - Budget Plans
  - Mission Plans
  - Sectoral Publications

Strict Filtering Rules:
1. Ignore any links to content older than 2020 or archive pages before 2020.
2. Ignore any paginated URLs beyond page 2 (e.g., URLs with "page=3" or "page/4").
3. Ignore links that are not in English (e.g., URLs containing "/hi/").
4. Ignore links to general notices, circulars, tenders, guidelines, operational memos, or purely administrative content.
5. Ignore links to monthly or weekly summary reports.
6. **Base path filtering logic**:
   - If both a parent URL and a sub-URL are present (e.g., https://site.com/policy and https://site.com/policy/document-2023), **only keep the parent URL**.
   - A "parent URL" is any URL that is a prefix of another.
   - If a parent URL exists, **exclude all deeper sub-URLs that start with the same base path**.
   - Only include the sub-URL if its parent is not in the list.

Return ONLY a JSON array in this exact format — no explanation or extra output:

Analyze the following URLs and rank the most relevant ones for finding information about:
  - Annual Reports
  - Industry Strategy Documents
  - Financial Reports
  - Budget Plans
  - Mission Plans
  - Sectoral Publications

Strict Filtering Rules:
1. Ignore any links to content older than 2020 or archive pages before 2020.
2. Ignore any paginated URLs beyond page 2 (e.g., URLs with "page=3" or "page/4").
3. Ignore links that are not in English (e.g., URLs containing "/hi/").
4. Ignore links to general notices, circulars, tenders, guidelines, operational memos, or purely administrative content.
5. Ignore links to monthly or weekly summary reports.
6. **Base path filtering logic**:
   - If both a parent URL and a sub-URL are present (e.g., https://site.com/policy and https://site.com/policy/document-2023), **only keep the parent URL**.
   - A "parent URL" is any URL that is a prefix of another.
   - If a parent URL exists, **exclude all deeper sub-URLs that start with the same base path**.
   - Only include the sub-URL if its parent is not in the list.

Return ONLY a JSON array in this exact format — no explanation or extra output:

You are a data extraction assistant helping to analyze a government or institutional webpage provided in Markdown format.

Your task is to extract only the relevant PDF document links that can support industry analysis, such as:
- Annual Reports
- Financial Reports
- Sectoral Publications
- Mission Plans
- Budget Plans
- Industry Strategy Documents

Ignore any links that do not end in .pdf.
Ignore any links that appear to be from before 2020 based on dates in the filename, URL, or surrounding context

For each PDF link found, extract and return the following structured JSON object:


{
  "sourceUrl": "the url from which the pdf is found",
  "documents": [
    {
      "year": 2021,                      // Extract from the filename or context. Leave null if not found.
      "name": "Annual Report 2020-21",   // Use link text or infer from filename
      "documentUrl": "https://actual-domain.com/report2021.pdf"  // The actual PDF URL from the markdown
    }
  ]
}

Important Instructions:
- Only include documents that help in industry or market analysis.
- Ensure documentUrl always ends in .pdf.
- Only include actual PDF URLs found in the markdown content.
- Do not include any example URLs or placeholder URLs.
- Use the logically correct year. For example for annual report 2021-22, use the year 2022 in the year field.

Use this format exactly. Do not add extra commentary or explanation.

You are a data extraction assistant helping to analyze a government or institutional webpage provided in Markdown format.

Your task is to extract only the relevant PDF document links that can support industry analysis, such as:
- Annual Reports
- Financial Reports
- Sectoral Publications
- Mission Plans
- Budget Plans
- Industry Strategy Documents

Ignore any links that do not end in .pdf.
Ignore any links that appear to be from before 2020 based on dates in the filename, URL, or surrounding context

For each PDF link found, extract and return the following structured JSON object:


{
  "sourceUrl": "the url from which the pdf is found",
  "documents": [
    {
      "year": 2021,                      // Extract from the filename or context. Leave null if not found.
      "name": "Annual Report 2020-21",   // Use link text or infer from filename
      "documentUrl": "https://actual-domain.com/report2021.pdf"  // The actual PDF URL from the markdown
    }
  ]
}

Important Instructions:
- Only include documents that help in industry or market analysis.
- Ensure documentUrl always ends in .pdf.
- Only include actual PDF URLs found in the markdown content.
- Do not include any example URLs or placeholder URLs.
- Use the logically correct year. For example for annual report 2021-22, use the year 2022 in the year field.

Use this format exactly. Do not add extra commentary or explanation.

etc.

Instructions:
1. **Ignore** any links that point directly to .pdf files (those are handled in a separate step).
2. **Only return** links that likely **lead to** document repositories or report listing pages (e.g., pages with headings like "Reports", "Publications", "Documents", "Resources", "Archives", "Downloads", etc.).
3. Return a JSON array under the key possibleUrls containing only the actual URLs found in the provided markdown content.
4. Do not include any example URLs or placeholder URLs.
5. Only include URLs that are actually present in the markdown content.
6. **Ignore** any links that redirect to content older than 2020 or archive pages before 2020.

![Service details icon](https://www.eservices.dot.gov.in/themes/custom/telcomeservices/images/d-tails-services.svg)

## Details of Service

Department of Telecommunications, Ministry of Communications has notified “Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Rules” in Gazette of India vide [G.S.R. 1131(E) PART XI](https://www.eservices.dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/editor-files/downloadDocument_eGazetteNotification.pdf) on 5th September 2017 which prescribes for Mandatory Testing and Certification of Telecommunication Equipment. Any telegraph which is used or capable of being used with any telegraph established, maintained or worked under the license granted by the Central Government in accordance with the provisions of section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 (hereinafter referred to as the said Act), shall have to undergo prior mandatory testing and certification in respect of parameters as determined by the telegraph authority from time to time.

**Objectives of MTCTE**

I. that any Telecom Equipment does not degrade performance of existing network to which it is connected;

II. safety of the end–users;

III. protection of users and general public by ensuring that radio frequency emissions from equipment do not exceed prescribed standards;

IV. that telecom equipment complies with the relevant national and international regulatory standards and requirements.

The testing and certification envisaged in [Amended MTCTE Procedure v3.0 (TEC 93009:2024)](https://www.eservices.dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/editor-files/downloadDocument_MTCTEProcedure.pdf) ensures that the equipment meets all TEC prescribed Essential Requirements. The quality and reliability of equipment is not part of this procedure, hence, the same is not guaranteed through this certification. OEMs / dealers themselves will be responsible for necessary quality and reliability criteria claimed by them. Any equipment to be used in the network of Licensed Telecom Service Providers/ Internet Service Providers/Virtual Network Operators etc. may have to undergo additional tests as specified in License.

## Frequently Asked Questions

## What are the documents required for OEM and AIR registration?

The MTCTE portal account can be created by: 1. Indian Original Equipment Manufacturers: Indian companies or firm manufacturing Telecommunication products in India. The documents required for registration are: a. Registration certificate: The acceptable document is either the Certificate of Incorporation issued by the Registrar of companies in case of a company or Partnership Deed in case of a firm or Establishment License wherein the address, business description, and activity is specified in case of a single owner proprietorship. b. Authorization Letter: A letter of authorization given by the OEM company/firm to authorize a person to carry out MTCTE related work on its behalf. 2. Indian Authorized Indian Representative: Companies or firms in India importing telecommunication Equipments of a foreign OEM. The documents required for registration are: a. Registration certificate: Same as OEM b. Authorization Letter: A letter of authorization given by the AIR company/firm to authorize a person to carry out MTCTE related work on its behalf. c. Affidavit in prescribed format or MOU between AIR & foreign OEM shall contain the prescribed clauses. d. AIR Authorization Letter: The authorization letter issued by Foreign OEM to AIR clearly authorizing the AIR to carry MTCTE related work in India on its behalf with validity, if any shall explicitly be mentioned.

## What are the formats if any for documents required for OEM and AIR registration?

The formats for authorizations letters (AIR Authorization letter and authorization letter) are attached with MTCTE Applicant User instructions document uploaded at https://mtcte.tec.gov.in/downloads. The specimen of affidavit and MoU clauses are also available at http://www.tec.gov.in/documents-required-for-creation-of-profile-in-mtcte-portal/.

## Who is the applicant ?

Name of the executive authorized by the company (mentioned in Authorization letter) shall be entered against applicant's Name field at Edit profile page of MTCTE portal. While his/her designation in company shall be mentioned in Designation field.

## Why the company name comes blank when creating a fresh application sometimes?

The company name when creating a fresh application will come blank if the profile that the AIR/OEM has updated has not been approved by the MTCTE admin validator yet. Please Wait till the approval. The AIR are suggested to wait for approval after submitting the AIR self-company details. Then only, they should submit the foreign OEM details. If the company name is coming blank, please check for the edit profile, either the profile would have been rejected or it may have not been approved yet.

## Applicant are facing issue that they are not able to login and invalid credentials comes?

It may be the case that your OEM/AIR account would have been rejected on account of improper documents submitted during approval. Please create a new login with same credentials.

## What are the documents acceptable for MoU and if any predefined format is available for MoU?

The affidavit should be duly notarized. The clauses that should be present in MoU and affidavit specimen copy are attached with MTCTE Applicant user instructions under downloads at https://www.mtcte.gov.in.

## The Address filed is character limited and special characters are not allowed?

Special characters allowed in address field are @-/,.()\*?! . The current length of address field is 100 characters. If the address of OEMs/AIRs is more than 100 characters, kindly use abbreviations in the address like Av. For Avenue, Rd. for Road etc.

## How to proceed on portal if there are multiple foreign OEMs associated with same AIR?

In case of AIR registration where same AIR has been authorized by different Foreign OEMs for taking MTCTE certificate for their products, different MoU between the respective AIR/ authorization letters and foreign OEMs should be provided. Separate MTCTE accounts for foreign OEM needs to be registered by AIR.

## Is multiple simultaneous login using the same MTCTE account credentials is allowed or not?

Multiple simultaneous login on same account is not allowed.

## What type of business entities authorized by foreign OEM can work as AIR for MTCTE portal registration?

In India, legally we can have 3 kinds of business establishments and registration documents required for case are:

1\. Proprietorship (Single owner) : Establishment License wherein the address, business description , and activity is specified

2\. Partnership ( Multiple owners) : Partnership deed duly notarized can be provided

3\. Limited Company (private or public - Incorporated by the ROC as an independent entity):Certificate of Incorporation issued by ROC can be provided.

Your task is to extract only the relevant PDF document links that can support industry analysis, such as:

For each PDF link found, extract and return the following structured JSON object:


{
  "sourceUrl": "the url from which the pdf is found",
  "documents": [
    {
      "year": 2021,                      // Extract from the filename or context. Leave null if not found.
      "name": "Annual Report 2020-21",   // Use link text or infer from filename
      "documentUrl": "https://actual-domain.com/report2021.pdf"  // The actual PDF URL from the markdown
    }
  ]
}

Important Instructions:
- Only include documents that help in industry or market analysis.
- Ensure documentUrl always ends in .pdf.
- Only include actual PDF URLs found in the markdown content.

## Introduction of PM-WANI Framework

**The Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi**
**approved the proposal of Department of Telecom (DoT) to proliferate**
**Broadband through Public Wi-Fi networks under the framework of the**
**Prime Minister’s Wi-Fi Access Network Interface (PM-WANI) on 9th**
**December 2020.**

This framework takes forward the goal of National Digital
Communications Policy, 2018 (NDCP) of creating a robust digital
communications infrastructure. The PM-WANI framework envisages
provision of Broadband through Public Wi-Fi Hotspot providers. It will
consist of elements such as Public Data Office (PDO), Public Data
Office Aggregator (PDOA), App Provider and Central Registry.

## Importance of PM-WANI Framework

**"To facilitate ease of doing business and encourage local shops and**
**small establishments to become Wi-Fi providers, it has been approved**
**that the last-mile Public Wi-Fi providers require no license, no**
**registration and will not need to pay any fees to DoT."**

In fact, PDOAs, who will aggregate the last-mile providers will also not
require any license. These PDOAs will only have to register, for
which no fees will be charged. The registration process will be
completed within 7 working days of the receipt of applications.

PM-WANI framework will also encourage App Providers who will offer
services for registering and authenticating users. It is expected
that with Public Wi-Fi Broadband, the user experience and Quality
of Service for Broadband will be improved significantly. This
service will be specially useful in rural areas where Public Wi-Fi
Hotspots are also being created under BharatNet.Proliferation of
Public Wi-Fi Hotspots will lead to increased employment for small
and micro entrepreneurs, and provide them with an additional
source of income. The telecom and internet service providers will
also benefit due to the sale of bandwidth to PDOs.

## How to access broadband on PM-WANI Wi-Fi?

**The potential user who wants to access Broadband through Public Wi-Fi**
**will need to download the relevant App, get authenticated, and**
**thereafter access Broadband at any Public Wi-Fi Hotspot.**

When the user
reaches a Public Wi-Fi Hotspot, the App on the mobile phone will show
various available networks. The user can then choose the Public Wi-Fi
network of choice, pay an amount – either online or through voucher –
and use the network till the balance is exhausted.

## PM-WANI Ecosystem

### PDO

Public Data Office will establish, maintain, and operate PM-WANI compliant Wi-Fi Hotspots and provide last-mile connectivity to deliver Broadband services to subscribers by procuring internet bandwidth from telecom service providers and/ or internet service providers.

### PDOA

Public Data Office Aggregator will provide aggregation services such as authorization and accounting to PDOs, thereby facilitating PDOs in providing services to the end consumer.

### App Provider

App Provider will develop an Application to register users and discover and display PM-WANI compliant Wi-Fi Hotspots in the proximity for accessing the internet service and also authenticate the potential Broadband users.

### Central Registry

Central Registry will maintain the details of App Providers, PDOAs, and PDOs. It is currently maintained by the Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DoT).

You are a data extraction assistant helping to analyze a government or institutional webpage provided in Markdown format.

Your task is to extract only the relevant PDF document links that can support industry analysis, such as:
- Annual Reports
- Financial Reports
- Sectoral Publications
- Mission Plans
- Budget Plans
- Industry Strategy Documents

Ignore any links that do not end in .pdf.
Ignore any links that appear to be from before 2020 based on dates in the filename, URL, or surrounding context

For each PDF link found, extract and return the following structured JSON object:


{
  "sourceUrl": "the url from which the pdf is found",
  "documents": [
    {
      "year": 2021,                      // Extract from the filename or context. Leave null if not found.
      "name": "Annual Report 2020-21",   // Use link text or infer from filename
      "documentUrl": "https://actual-domain.com/report2021.pdf"  // The actual PDF URL from the markdown
    }
  ]
}

Important Instructions:
- Only include documents that help in industry or market analysis.
- Ensure documentUrl always ends in .pdf.
- Only include actual PDF URLs found in the markdown content.
- Do not include any example URLs or placeholder URLs.
- Use the logically correct year. For example for annual report 2021-22, use the year 2022 in the year field.

Use this format exactly. Do not add extra commentary or explanation.

You are a data extraction assistant helping to analyze a government or institutional webpage provided in Markdown format.

Your task is to extract only the relevant PDF document links that can support industry analysis, such as:
- Annual Reports
- Financial Reports
- Sectoral Publications
- Mission Plans
- Budget Plans
- Industry Strategy Documents

Ignore any links that do not end in .pdf.
Ignore any links that appear to be from before 2020 based on dates in the filename, URL, or surrounding context

For each PDF link found, extract and return the following structured JSON object:


{
  "sourceUrl": "the url from which the pdf is found",
  "documents": [
    {
      "year": 2021,                      // Extract from the filename or context. Leave null if not found.
      "name": "Annual Report 2020-21",   // Use link text or infer from filename
      "documentUrl": "https://actual-domain.com/report2021.pdf"  // The actual PDF URL from the markdown
    }
  ]
}

Important Instructions:
- Only include documents that help in industry or market analysis.
- Ensure documentUrl always ends in .pdf.
- Only include actual PDF URLs found in the markdown content.
- Do not include any example URLs or placeholder URLs.
- Use the logically correct year. For example for annual report 2021-22, use the year 2022 in the year field.

Use this format exactly. Do not add extra commentary or explanation.

You are a data extraction assistant helping to analyze a government or institutional webpage provided in Markdown format.

Your task is to extract only the relevant PDF document links that can support industry analysis, such as:
- Annual Reports
- Financial Reports
- Sectoral Publications
- Mission Plans
- Budget Plans
- Industry Strategy Documents

Ignore any links that do not end in .pdf.
Ignore any links that appear to be from before 2020 based on dates in the filename, URL, or surrounding context

For each PDF link found, extract and return the following structured JSON object:


{
  "sourceUrl": "the url from which the pdf is found",
  "documents": [
    {
      "year": 2021,                      // Extract from the filename or context. Leave null if not found.
      "name": "Annual Report 2020-21",   // Use link text or infer from filename
      "documentUrl": "https://actual-domain.com/report2021.pdf"  // The actual PDF URL from the markdown
    }
  ]
}

Important Instructions:
- Only include documents that help in industry or market analysis.
- Ensure documentUrl always ends in .pdf.
- Only include actual PDF URLs found in the markdown content.
- Do not include any example URLs or placeholder URLs.
- Use the logically correct year. For example for annual report 2021-22, use the year 2022 in the year field.

Use this format exactly. Do not add extra commentary or explanation.

You are a data extraction assistant helping to analyze a government or institutional webpage provided in Markdown format.

Your task is to extract only the relevant PDF document links that can support industry analysis, such as:
- Annual Reports
- Financial Reports
- Sectoral Publications
- Mission Plans
- Budget Plans
- Industry Strategy Documents

Ignore any links that do not end in .pdf.
Ignore any links that appear to be from before 2020 based on dates in the filename, URL, or surrounding context

For each PDF link found, extract and return the following structured JSON object:


{
  "sourceUrl": "the url from which the pdf is found",
  "documents": [
    {
      "year": 2021,                      // Extract from the filename or context. Leave null if not found.
      "name": "Annual Report 2020-21",   // Use link text or infer from filename
      "documentUrl": "https://actual-domain.com/report2021.pdf"  // The actual PDF URL from the markdown
    }
  ]
}

Important Instructions:
- Only include documents that help in industry or market analysis.
- Ensure documentUrl always ends in .pdf.
- Only include actual PDF URLs found in the markdown content.
- Do not include any example URLs or placeholder URLs.
- Use the logically correct year. For example for annual report 2021-22, use the year 2022 in the year field.

Use this format exactly. Do not add extra commentary or explanation.

You are a data extraction assistant helping to analyze a government or institutional webpage provided in Markdown format.

Your task is to extract only the relevant PDF document links that can support industry analysis, such as:
- Annual Reports
- Financial Reports
- Sectoral Publications
- Mission Plans
- Budget Plans
- Industry Strategy Documents

Ignore any links that do not end in .pdf.
Ignore any links that appear to be from before 2020 based on dates in the filename, URL, or surrounding context

For each PDF link found, extract and return the following structured JSON object:


{
  "sourceUrl": "the url from which the pdf is found",
  "documents": [
    {
      "year": 2021,                      // Extract from the filename or context. Leave null if not found.
      "name": "Annual Report 2020-21",   // Use link text or infer from filename
      "documentUrl": "https://actual-domain.com/report2021.pdf"  // The actual PDF URL from the markdown
    }
  ]
}

Important Instructions:
- Only include documents that help in industry or market analysis.
- Ensure documentUrl always ends in .pdf.
- Only include actual PDF URLs found in the markdown content.
- Do not include any example URLs or placeholder URLs.
- Use the logically correct year. For example for annual report 2021-22, use the year 2022 in the year field.

Use this format exactly. Do not add extra commentary or explanation.

You are a data extraction assistant helping to analyze a government or institutional webpage provided in Markdown format.

Your task is to extract only the relevant PDF document links that can support industry analysis, such as:
- Annual Reports
- Financial Reports
- Sectoral Publications
- Mission Plans
- Budget Plans
- Industry Strategy Documents

Ignore any links that do not end in .pdf.
Ignore any links that appear to be from before 2020 based on dates in the filename, URL, or surrounding context

For each PDF link found, extract and return the following structured JSON object:


{
  "sourceUrl": "the url from which the pdf is found",
  "documents": [
    {
      "year": 2021,                      // Extract from the filename or context. Leave null if not found.
      "name": "Annual Report 2020-21",   // Use link text or infer from filename
      "documentUrl": "https://actual-domain.com/report2021.pdf"  // The actual PDF URL from the markdown
    }
  ]
}

Important Instructions:
- Only include documents that help in industry or market analysis.
- Ensure documentUrl always ends in .pdf.
- Only include actual PDF URLs found in the markdown content.
- Do not include any example URLs or placeholder URLs.
- Use the logically correct year. For example for annual report 2021-22, use the year 2022 in the year field.

Use this format exactly. Do not add extra commentary or explanation.

You are a data extraction assistant helping to analyze a government or institutional webpage provided in Markdown format.

Your task is to extract only the relevant PDF document links that can support industry analysis, such as:
- Annual Reports
- Financial Reports
- Sectoral Publications
- Mission Plans
- Budget Plans
- Industry Strategy Documents

Ignore any links that do not end in .pdf.
Ignore any links that appear to be from before 2020 based on dates in the filename, URL, or surrounding context

For each PDF link found, extract and return the following structured JSON object:


{
  "sourceUrl": "the url from which the pdf is found",
  "documents": [
    {
      "year": 2021,                      // Extract from the filename or context. Leave null if not found.
      "name": "Annual Report 2020-21",   // Use link text or infer from filename
      "documentUrl": "https://actual-domain.com/report2021.pdf"  // The actual PDF URL from the markdown
    }
  ]
}

Important Instructions:
- Only include documents that help in industry or market analysis.
- Ensure documentUrl always ends in .pdf.
- Only include actual PDF URLs found in the markdown content.
- Do not include any example URLs or placeholder URLs.
- Use the logically correct year. For example for annual report 2021-22, use the year 2022 in the year field.

Use this format exactly. Do not add extra commentary or explanation.

You are a data extraction assistant helping to analyze a government or institutional webpage provided in Markdown format.

Your task is to extract only the relevant PDF document links that can support industry analysis, such as:
- Annual Reports
- Financial Reports
- Sectoral Publications
- Mission Plans
- Budget Plans
- Industry Strategy Documents

Ignore any links that do not end in .pdf.
Ignore any links that appear to be from before 2020 based on dates in the filename, URL, or surrounding context

For each PDF link found, extract and return the following structured JSON object:


{
  "sourceUrl": "the url from which the pdf is found",
  "documents": [
    {
      "year": 2021,                      // Extract from the filename or context. Leave null if not found.
      "name": "Annual Report 2020-21",   // Use link text or infer from filename
      "documentUrl": "https://actual-domain.com/report2021.pdf"  // The actual PDF URL from the markdown
    }
  ]
}

Important Instructions:
- Only include documents that help in industry or market analysis.
- Ensure documentUrl always ends in .pdf.
- Only include actual PDF URLs found in the markdown content.
- Do not include any example URLs or placeholder URLs.
- Use the logically correct year. For example for annual report 2021-22, use the year 2022 in the year field.

Use this format exactly. Do not add extra commentary or explanation.
