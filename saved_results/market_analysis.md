- **1981 to 2019 (38 years):**  
  \[
  CAGR = \left(\frac{10.93}{1.28}\right)^{\frac{1}{38}} - 1 = (8.54)^{0.0263} - 1 \approx 0.0618 \text{ or } 6.18\%
  \]

- **2001 to 2019 (18 years):**  
  \[
  CAGR = \left(\frac{10.93}{2.54}\right)^{\frac{1}{18}} - 1 = (4.30)^{0.0555} - 1 \approx 0.0855 \text{ or } 8.55\%
  \]

### Year-on-Year (YoY) Growth (2011–2019 approximated)

- Increase from 6.31 million to 10.93 million in 8 years  
- Approximate average YoY growth ≈ 7.3%  

### Post-Pandemic Recovery Indicator

---

## 5. Notable Growth Indicators

### Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)

Calculating CAGR for different periods based on available data:

- **2011 to 2019:**

\[
CAGR = \left(\frac{2322}{865}\right)^{\frac{1}{8}} - 1 = \left(2.6844\right)^{0.125} - 1 \approx 13.2\%
\]

- **2019 to 2023:**

\[
CAGR = \left(\frac{2510}{2322}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}} - 1 = \left(1.0806\right)^{0.25} - 1 \approx 1.96\%
\]

*Note:* This includes the disruption period; actual growth from 2021 to 2023 is much higher.

### Year-over-Year (YOY) Change Highlights

| Period    | Visits (Millions) | YOY Change %                |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| 2018-2019 | ~*unknown-2322*   | Positive growth hitting peak|

# Conclusion

Domestic tourism has exhibited robust growth from 2011 to 2019 with a CAGR of approximately 13.2%. The pandemic caused a severe decline in 2020-2021 with visits dropping drastically by over 70%. However, a strong recovery phase pushed visits in 2023 to 2510 million, exceeding the previous peak and indicating strong resilience and market potential. Continued growth post-pandemic suggests renewed consumer confidence and demand for domestic travel.

## 3. Important Trends and Patterns

- **Pre-Pandemic Stability (2018-19 to 2019-20):**  
  - Tourism maintained a stable direct contribution to both GVA and GDP, reflecting a mature and steadily growing sector.
  - The GVA multiplier remained consistent, indicating stable indirect economic spillovers.

- **Pandemic Impact (2020-21):**  
  - Sharp decline in tourism direct GVA and GDP contribution, mirroring the impact of travel bans and lockdowns.
  - Total GVA and GDP also saw contraction, but the tourism sector was disproportionately affected.
  - Drop in tourism’s share of GVA and GDP shows sector vulnerability during crises.

- **Recovery Phase (2021-22 and 2022-23):**  
  - Strong rebound observed in tourism metrics, with 2022-23 figures approaching or surpassing pre-pandemic levels.
  - Growth in tourism’s share of overall GVA and GDP suggests enhanced importance post-recovery.
  - Increasing GVA multiplier indicates improved indirect contributions, possibly due to diversified tourism activities and domestic demand.

---

## 4. Regional or Segment-Specific Insights

- While the table does not explicitly break down data by region or segment, the observed trends imply:
  - **Domestic tourism** likely led the recovery phases, especially in 2021-22 and 2022-23, as international travel restrictions lingered.
  - States or regions relying heavily on international tourists may have experienced slower recovery relative to those with strong domestic travel markets.
  - Indirect contributions growing faster than direct ones suggest expansion in ancillary sectors such as hospitality, transport, and entertainment linked to tourism.

---

## 5. Notable Growth Indicators (CAGR, YOY)

### Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR):

- Calculated for **Tourism Direct GVA** (2018-19 to 2022-23):

  \[
  \text{CAGR} = \left(\frac{T\_GVA5}{T\_GVA1}\right)^{\tfrac{1}{4}} - 1
  \]

- Similarly, CAGR for:
  - Tourism Direct GDP
  - Total GVA and GDP to contextualize tourism growth relative to overall economy

### Year-on-Year (YOY) Growth:

| Year      | YOY Growth Tourism Direct GVA (%) | YOY Growth Tourism Direct GDP (%) |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 2019-20   | ((T_GVA2 - T_GVA1)/T_GVA1)*100   | ((T_GDP2 - T_GDP1)/T_GDP1)*100   |
| 2020-21   | Significant decline anticipated   | Significant decline anticipated  |
| 2021-22   | Strong positive recovery           | Strong positive recovery          |
| 2022-23   | Further growth / stabilization     | Further growth / stabilization    |

- The YOY drops in 2020-21 reflect the pandemic’s impact.
- Rapid YOY growth in subsequent years represent sector rebounding and pent-up demand release.

---

## Conclusion & Recommendations

- The tourism sector in India shows robust capacity to bounce back after adverse shocks, with rising contributions to both GVA and GDP.
- Increasing multipliers underline expanding indirect economic benefits, enhancing tourism’s overall value proposition.
- Policymakers should:
  - Foster infrastructure and safety protocols to sustain growth.
  - Focus on segment and region-specific recovery strategies to balance international and domestic tourism.
- Businesses can leverage these positive growth trends by investing in diversified tourism products and services.
